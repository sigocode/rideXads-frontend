# rideXads — Demo Landing (React + Vite + Tailwind)

This is a one-page demo site for **rideXads** — use it as the website link when applying for affiliate/API access (Flipkart, etc).

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Notes
- Replace `YOUR_AFFILIATE_ID` in `src/data/products.js` with your affiliate tracking id.
- This is a demo static frontend. Once you get API access you can replace mock data with your backend endpoints.
